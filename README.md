# Distributed-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Intelligent-Agents-ID2201

This course introduces fundamental principles and techniques of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), as well as the usage of such techniques for creating applications in distributed computing environments. Central to the course are the concepts of "intelligent agents", as a paradigm for creating autonomous software components, and “multi-agent systems” as a way of providing coordination and communication between individual autonomous software components.

* Introduction and basic concepts for DAI (distributed artificial intelligence).
* Coordination methods general models, joint coordination techniques, organizational structures, information exchange on the metalevel, multi-agent planning, explicit analysis and synchronisation.
* Negotiation methods: principles, protocols, production sequencing as negotiations, conventions for automatic negotiations.
* Interoperability: Methods for interoperation of software, speech acts, KQML, FIPA.
* Multi-agent architectures: Low-level architectural support, DAI-testbeds, agent oriented software development.
* Agent theory: Fundamentals of modal logic, the BDI architecture.
* Agent architectures: deliberative, reactive and hybrid architectures.
* Mobile agents: requirements, implementation, safety for mobile agents, environments for mobile agents. Agent typology and technical questions. Applications.
* Practical part of the course that contains exercises and a project that includes implementation of a multi-agent system.

### Intended learning outcomes

formulate definitions of the most important concepts and the methods for intelligent agents and multi-agent systems evaluate and use the most important concepts and the methods in the area for intelligent agents and multi-agent systems.
